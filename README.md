# What is Kinto?
Kinto is an **Ethereum L2 rollup designed to accelerate the transition to an on-chain financial system**. It features **permissionless KYC/AML and native account abstraction** to solve the two biggest blockers to mainstream adoption: compliance and user experience.

# High Level Architecture

## Modular Stack
We adopted the modular thesis to maximize decentralization, credible neutrality, and scalability. The modular thesis, where different layers of the blockchain architecture are separated and optimized, allows each layer to function more efficiently. Let's analyze the different components of the Kinto rollup:

- **Settlement**: From day one, Kinto used Ethereum as the settlement layer. Ethereum is the network with the most mature infrastructure for on-chain financial applications and the most censorship-resistant, neutral block space.
- **Execution**: On the execution layer, we announced our partnership with Arbitrum a few weeks ago, becoming the first Arbitrum-based L2. Arbitrum is the undisputed L2 leader in TVL, maturity, and size of its DeFi ecosystem.
- **Data Availability**:  We have partnered with Celestia.  Kinto will tap into Celestia via Blobstream on Ethereum Mainnet, which provides L2s secure on-chain access to Celestiaâ€™s data root for integration with the bridge and Nitro. You can read our announcement here.
- **Sequencer**: Initially, Kinto will run its sequencer, but we are talking with Espresso and others to transition to a decentralized sequencing system.

## Kinto Unique Features

* **KYC & AML at the chain level**. Every user and developer must undergo our user-owned KYC process before transacting on the network.
* **Smart-Contract Wallets Only**. Users must create their non-custodial Kinto Wallet. Transactions initiated by EOAs are disabled and must be sent via Account Abstraction and its Entry Point.
* **Sybil Resistance**. Having KYC at the chain level opens a new design space where every application is automatically sybil-resistant.
* **Higher Level of Security**. Combining KYC/AML and Sybil Resistance with smart contract wallets provides a higher level of safety for both users and developers.

You can read more about our architecture [here](https://docs.kinto.xyz/kinto-the-safe-l2/building-on-kinto/kinto-rollup-architecture).

## Important Technical Considerations

* Kinto is fully EVM-compatible.
* To send a transaction, you must have a KintoWallet, and its first signer must hold a Kinto ID. The transaction must be sent to the entry point.
* Only four contracts can receive direct transactions from EOAs: EntryPoint, SponsorPaymaster, KintoWalletFactory, and Kinto ID.
* KintoWallet is fully non-custodial, but there is a way for users to recover their accounts through a week-long recovery process.
* EOAs can perform calls that don't alter the chain's state without KYC.
* Users do not need to pay for transactions. Developers will charge users and top the paymaster to cover the applications users send to their contracts.
* If a user gets added to a sanction list, his NFT will automatically be updated with this information.
* Kinto core contracts are upgradeable. Upgradeable powers will eventually be handed out to governance.

# Development

This repository contains all the core smart contracts available at Kinto.

* Kinto ID gives developers all the functionality to verify on-chain whether a given address has the appropriate KYC, accreditation requirements. Kinto ID also provides functionality to check AML sanctions.
* KintoWallet and KintoWalletFactory have all the code required to create wallets and deploy contracts.
* SponsorPaymaster is the Account Abstraction Paymaster of Kinto.

## Requirements

- Install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- Copy .env.sample to .env and fill the values. After you deploy the proxy make sure to fill its address as well.

### Enable CREATE2 in a custom chain (only needed in a custom chain)

Fund the signer `0x3fab184622dc19b6109349b94811493bf2a45362` to deploy the arachnid proxy:

```
cast send 0x3fab184622dc19b6109349b94811493bf2a45362 --value 0.03ether --private-key <your_private_key> --rpc-url $KINTO_RPC_URL
```

Send the following transaction using foundry. Make sure you disable EIP-155:

```
cast publish f8a58085174876e800830186a08080b853604580600e600039806000f350fe7fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe03601600081602082378035828234f58015156039578182fd5b8082525050506014600cf31ba02222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222a02222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222  --rpc-url <NODE_OPEN_EIP155>
```
Now we should have the proxy live at `0x4e59b44847b379578588920ca78fbf26c0b4956c`.

## Testing

In order to run the tests, execute the following command:

```
forge test
```

### Calling the Kinto ID smart contract

Check that the contract is deployed:

cast call $ID_PROXY_ADDRESS "name()(string)" --rpc-url $KINTO_RPC_URL

Check KYC on an address

```
cast call $ID_PROXY_ADDRESS "isKYC(address)(bool)" 0xa8beb41cf4721121ea58837ebdbd36169a7f246e  --rpc-url $KINTO_RPC_URL
```

### Funding a smart contract that pays for the transactions of its users

```
cast send <ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS> "addDepositFor(address)" <ADDR> --value 0.1ether
```

### Exporting contracts ABI for frontend

```
yarn run export-testnet
```

## Deploying

### Deploy all core contracts

Here is the code to deploy the Kinto ID and all the contracts required by account abstraction under the PUBLIC_KEY/PRIVATE_KEY signer:

```
source .env && forge script script/deploy.sol:KintoInitialDeployScript --rpc-url $KINTO_RPC_URL --broadcast -vvvv --skip-simulation --slow
```

To deploy with ledger:

```
source .env && forge script script/deploy.sol:KintoInitialDeployScript --rpc-url $KINTO_RPC_URL --broadcast --slow --ledger --sender <ADDR> --gas-estimate-multiplier 100 --legacy --skip-simulation --block-gas-limit 8000000000000000000
```

### Create Kinto Smart Account

After you have deployed all core contracts, you can call the following script to deploy an account.
If it already exists, it won't deploy it.

```
source .env && forge script script/test.sol:KintoDeployTestWalletScript --rpc-url $KINTO_RPC_URL --broadcast -vvvv  --skip-simulation --slow
```

### Test Kinto Smart Account with Counter contract

After you have deployed all core contracts and you have a wallet, you can call the following script to deploy an custom contract and execute an op through your smart account.
If it already exists, it won't deploy it.

```
source .env && forge script script/test.sol:KintoDeployTestCounter --rpc-url $KINTO_RPC_URL --broadcast -vvvv  --skip-simulation --slow
```

### Upgrade Kinto ID to a new version

```
source .env && forge script script/upgrade.sol:KintoIDUpgradeScript --rpc-url $KINTO_RPC_URL --broadcast -vvvv
```

### Deploying manually other contracts

In order to deploy non upgradeable contracts, use the following command:

```
forge create --rpc-url $KINTO_RPC_URL --private-key <your_private_key> src/<CONTRACT_NAME>
```

### Verifying smart contracts on blockscout

On Testnet:

```
forge verify-contract --watch --verifier blockscout --chain-id 42888 --verifier-url http://test-explorer.kinto.xyz/api --num-of-optimizations 100000 0xE40C427226D78060062670E341b0d8D8e66d725A ETHPriceIsRight
```
